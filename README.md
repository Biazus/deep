Practicing transfer learning.

Although this code is just for practing and should not be considered that serious, I want to come back again someday and resolve this TODO list:

- Create a single build model method (maybe pass the layer config as a json or yml?)
- Cleanup main.py file (Remove hardcoded paths, make it more readable etc, remove duplicated code)
- Save weights option (so that we don't need to retrain the first model each time we run the app)
- Create a decent README file ðŸ˜Š
